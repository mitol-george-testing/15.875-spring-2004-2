Teams report their progress on the term-long project to a portion of the class during the weekly "breakout sessions". These classes are opportunities for groups to give slideshow presentations explaining their work and accomplishments during the previous week. Topics for each of the breakout session presentations are explained in the weekly handouts, available below.
